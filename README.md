* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask
